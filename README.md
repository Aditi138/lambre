# Morphological Evaluation of NLG

L'AMBRE is a tool to measure the grammatical well-formedness of texts generated by NLG systems. It analyzes the dependency parses of the text using morpho-syntactic rules, and returns a well-formedness score. This tool utilizes the Surface Syntactic Universal Dependency ([SUD](https://surfacesyntacticud.github.io)) project both for extracting rules as well as parsing, and is therefore applicable across languages. See our [EMNLP 2021 paper](https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.570/) for more details.

## Getting Started

### Install dependencies

```bash
python setup.py install
```

### Try L'AMBRE

```bash
lambre ru data/txt/ru.txt # Russian
lambre de data/txt/de.txt # German
```

Run `lambre --help` for more options.

## Morpho-syntactic Rules

`lambre` provides two rule sets, `chaudhury-etal-2021` (see [Chaudhury et al., 2020](https://aclanthology.org/2020.emnlp-main.422/), [2021](https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.553/)) and `pratapa-etal-2021` (see [Pratapa et al., 2021](https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.570)). The former is the default, but the rule set can be specified using `--rule-set` option.

## Parser

We provide SUD parsers trained using [Stanza](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza/) toolkit. See section 4 in [our paper](https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.570) for details on the parsers.
