# Morphological Evaluation of NLG

L'AMBRE is a tool to measure the grammatical well-formedness of texts generated by NLG systems. It analyzes the dependency parses of the text using morpho-syntactic rules, and returns a well-formedness score. This tool utilizes the Universal Dependency (UD) project both for extracting rules as well as parsing, and is therefore applicable across languages. See our [EMNLP 2021 paper](https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.570/) for more details.
