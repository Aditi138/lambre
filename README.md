# Morphological Evaluation of NLG

L'AMBRE is a tool to measure the grammatical well-formedness of texts generated by NLG systems. It analyzes the dependency parses of the text using morpho-syntactic rules, and returns a well-formedness score. This tool utilizes the Surface Syntactic Universal Dependency ([SUD](https://surfacesyntacticud.github.io)) project both for extracting rules as well as parsing, and is therefore applicable across languages. See our [EMNLP 2021 paper](https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.570/) for more details.

## Getting Started

### Install

```bash
python -m pip install -e .
```

### Try L'AMBRE

For a given input text file, `lambre` computes a morpho-syntactic well-formedness score [0-1]. The following method first downloads the parsers and rule sets for the specified language before computing the document-level score. See the output folder (`out`) for error visualizations.

```python
import lambre
lambre.score("ru", "data/txt/ru.txt") # Russian
# lambre.score("de", "data/txt/de.txt")
# lambre.score("en", "data/txt/en.txt")
```

L'AMBRE can also be used from command line. See `lambre --help` for more options.

```bash
lambre ru data/txt/ru.txt
```

## Morpho-syntactic Rules

`lambre` currently supports two rule sets, `chaudhary-etal-2021` (see [Chaudhary et al., 2020](https://aclanthology.org/2020.emnlp-main.422/), [2021](https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.553/)) and `pratapa-etal-2021` (see [Pratapa et al., 2021](https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.570)). The former is the default, but the rule set can be specified using `--rule-set` option.

## Parser

We provide SUD parsers trained using [Stanza](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza/) toolkit. See section 4 in [our paper](https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.570) for more details.

## Supported Languages

We currently support the following languages. `lambre` automatically downloads the necessary language-specific resources (when available).

| Language     | Code | Language     | Code | Language     | Code | Language     | Code |
| --------     | ---- | --------     | ---- | --------     | ---- | --------     | ---- |
| Catalan      | ca   | Spanish      | es   | Italian      | it   | Russian      | ru   |
| Czech        | cs   | Estonian     | et   | Latvian      | lv   | Slovenian    | sl   |
| Danish       | da   | Persian      | fa   | Dutch        | nl   | Swedish      | sv   |
| German       | de   | French       | fr   | Polish       | pl   | Ukrainian    | uk   |
| Greek        | el   | Hindi        | hi   | Portuguese   | pt   | Urdu         | ur   |
| English      | en   | Indonesian   | id   | Romanian     | ro   |              |      |

To manually download rules or parsers for a given language,

```python
import lambre
lambre.download("ru") # Russian
```
